## RetroShooter

Retro shooter is an FPS game created in Unity, heavily inspired by old classics of this genre such as Wolfenstein 3D or Doom, but with modernized mechanics. The game is far from being finished, I have only prepared the test level. There are several types of weapons at the playerâ€™s disposal, including pistol,  shotgun or  rocket launcher. The player can collect first aid kits that restore his health. The AI of enemies works on the principle of a state machine, i.e. when the opponent notices player he starts to chase us. Then, if we lose the pursuit he looks arround for character but after few seconds he returns to normal patrol.
